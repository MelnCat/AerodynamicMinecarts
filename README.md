# AerodynamicMinecarts

https://modrinth.com/mod/aerodynamicminecarts

Removes the `minecartMaxSpeed` gamerule limit, removes minecart air resistance, and significantly reduces rail friction.

This allows minecarts to continue moving in the air for much longer, eliminating drag. Minecarts on rails will also have much less friction, allowing for greater maximum speed.
